## **Component Module**

This module contains all util and helper classes for feature modules, also holds common resources for avoiding duplication.



**Binding**: binding adapter functions to be used in two-way data binding

**Paging**: helper classes for easy use of the paging library, and avoid boilerplate codes. check [CommunityFragmentSimple](../../feature/community/src/main/java/net/tandem/community/ui/community/CommunityFragmentSimple.kt) class for sample usage and see how easy it is to implement a list using pagination with these helper classes.
